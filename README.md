# Processor Design (Toy Numpy)

## Description
- Built a simplified NumPy-style matrix computation library in C, focusing on efficient memory layout and low-level optimizations
- Implemented operations such as vector addition, dot products, and matrix multiplication, exploring tradeoffs between row-major and column-major ordering
- Managed parallelism, cache efficiency, and how high-level numerical libraries map down to hardware operations

## Tech Stack
- C
- Git
- GitHub
